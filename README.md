# Loramac-node ESP32 Fork

  

This is a fork of the [Loramac-node](https://github.com/Lora-net/LoRaMac-node) library, which provides support for the ESP32 microcontroller. The aim of this fork is to extend the functionality of the original Loramac-node library, enabling users to seamlessly integrate the ESP32 device into their LoRaWAN projects.

  

## Features

  

- Full support for the ESP32 microcontroller

- Compatible with the original Loramac-node library

- Integration with ESP-IDF (Espressif IoT Development Framework)

- Additional examples tailored for ESP32

  

## Prerequisites

Before you can use this fork, ensure that you have the following tools installed:

  

1. [ESP-IDF](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/index.html) (tested only in v5.x.x or later)

2. A LoRaWAN gateway within range of your ESP32 device

3. A LoRaWAN network server, such as The Things Network
